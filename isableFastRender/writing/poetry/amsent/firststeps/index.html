<p><strong>American Sentences: Origins</strong><br>
<em>(These were the first Sentences I ever wrote)</em></p>
<p>My mother came from a land across the sea many miles she flew to here.</p>
<p>My father grew up picking apples and cherries on big orchards.<br>

<hr>
<p><strong>American Agates</strong><br>
<em>(May 5th, 2024)</em><br>
On the beach, my father collects stones that tumbled down from the mountains.<br>

<hr>
<p><strong>American Sunburn</strong><br>
<em>(May 5th, 2024)</em><br>
I guess I’m at an age now where the sun burns my pa and me.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Double American Lives</strong><br>
<em>(May 5th 2024)</em><br>
On the shores of the Chesapeake, my pockets heavy with rocks, I look at the ships and wonder what the weight of a life would be in my pocket.<img src="/images/writing/poetry/AmSent/dbleLives.jpg" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>American Old Men</strong><br>
<em>(May 7th, 2024)</em><br>
Old men are all the same, bemoaning how things are so different now.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>American Letters</strong><br>
<em>(May 7th, 2024)</em><br>
American pages, laid to rest by the flag and hands that read them.</p>
