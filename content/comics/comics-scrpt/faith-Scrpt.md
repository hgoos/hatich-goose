**Notes:** Another experiment in repeat panels, specifically focusing on using repeat panels to create space between each line of dialogue or moment. Coloring and lighting practice here as well. 
There is certainly a way to condense this script so that it’s shorter and makes more efficient use of space. However, want to acknowledge that in a shorter script the writer has more control over the panel structure. In a 6+ issue run it’s tedious and inefficient for the writer to try and retain full control over every single panel and every single page. 

I'm also aware that this story is heavily influenced by my own personal beliefs about Superman and his upbringing. Being raised in a rural Kansas farm town, he probably would've grown up going to Protestant chruch. However, I do not want to erase or ignore the fact that Superman (and most comcics) are products of Jewish-American creators and experiences. I don't think this comic would ever be published in an anthology, nor would I necessarily want it to. I think it's ok if Clark Kent and Superman remain neutral. I'll leave that Catholic Guilt to Matt Murdock. I think what matters more is that Superman and Clark Kent embody and display kindness and hope above all---religious affiliations aside.

**2x3 Panels, Separated, Read Top-Down Left Right**  
The panels line each side of the page, with SUPERMAN praying in the middle.  
Each panel contains details of the stained glass windows, of which there are six. These depict various scenes from the Bible, or various biblical images.
