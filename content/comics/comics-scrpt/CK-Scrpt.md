**Notes:** The purpose of this story is to practice comic script formatting and the re-use of panel structures in order to streamline personal comic process. Additionally, since I am a poor colorist, this comic will make use of the gray scale and contrast in order to convey depth and distinction. 
You can find the comic <a href="/comics/comics-art/c-k/">here.</a>

I was hoping he would show.

He’s a busy man. I believe tonight he must make an appearance as Bruce Wayne.

<em>ROBIN</em><br>
Was this about earlier today?<br>

Father told me what happened.
</p>

Close-up of SUPERMAN. He is frowning, his eyes closed, as if he doesn’t want to remember what ROBIN is talking about.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>CAPTION (DAMIAN)</em><br>
Assailant was Miles Greenway.

If that’s what you want to call it.
</p>

SUPERMAN is looking at ROBIN and giving him a slight smile.

<p style="text-align:center;">

You stopped him without violence and no one, including the man, was hurt.<br>
Why are you still upset?
</p>

**Panel 1**
ROBIN sits criss-cross-applesauce.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>ROBIN</em><br>
I’m reminded of it everyday.
</p>

**Panel 2A**
SUPERMAN glancing at ROBIN. He is frowning. ROBIN’s mouth is open, as if he’s speaking.

**1x3 Panel Structure (Read Left-Right)**

**Panel 1:** A woman, presumably TALIA AL-GHUL, holding a flamberge in the foreground. In the background, a younger version of DAMIAN holding a sword of his own at the ready.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>CAPTION (DAMIAN)</em><br>
My own mother honed me into a tool for violence.
</p>

**Panel 2:** DAMIAN, in his League of Shadows/Assassins gear, crouching on a building edge. Behind him, silhouettes of skyscrapers loom.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>CAPTION</em><br>
I…
</p>

**Panel 3:** A man in a suit, lying in a pool of his own blood. In the foreground, DAMIAN (still in his League gear) walks out of frame.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>CAPTION</em><br>
I did that for a while too.
</p>

**Panel 1A (second)**
SUPERMAN glances to the side at ROBIN.

<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>ROBIN</em><br>
Father says it’s naive to expect people to be kind in a world that was so cruel to them.<br>
He says I can’t get upset every time someone disappoints me in that regard.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>SUPERMAN</em><br>
Your father is a smart man, Damian, but he doesn’t always---
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>ROBIN</em><br>
But I agree.<br>
I was a cruel person Uncle Clark, for a long time. But I was also a child. I didn’t have a choice. I’ve learned that you have to let some of these things go. You have to let the cruelty of people go. You can’t give it too much thought. If you do you let it live. You let it become something. Because in the end it doesn’t matter. What matters is you tried to help. And you tried your best.
</p>

End.
