**Mvmnt. I.**

And the people living in the darkness
Have seen a great light.

And he said unto me:
*Vertiatem dīc omnibus.* 

And he said unto us:
*Vertiatem dīc omnibus.* 

My fellow velites
My contubernium of Christ

Did they hear this plea upon the cross?

This fire that burns in me
The same that made Moses holy

Will I, the eagle, immolate? 

---
**Mvmnt. II.**

When I was young I knew of a boy
Who burned with fever day and night
“That’s spiritual war,” they said. 

I too was at war
Not with the spirit of the Enemy
But with the spirit of Rome

My fellow legionnaires
My fellow centurions
My fellow citizens 

Stood across the battlefield 
I heard the Spirit say to me:
*Veritatem dīc omnibus.*

But I, like Moses, was afraid
And gave no sermon
But demanded instead Revelations

But the serpent’s tongue flicked 
And the complexities of the 
Rapture escaped me.

---
**Mvmnt. III.**

I took flight, afraid, my ragged wings
Picked me across the Atlantic

Doused my fire 

Tossed me wild to Eurus and Neptune
Adrift I spent my days unprotected

A deserter

The rule of decimation does not apply 
To a corrupted force

*Veritatem dīc omnibus*

Where now was the armor of God?
Had I been stripped of it, rank and helm?

Had I relieved myself of it with mine own hands?
I could not remember. 

---
**Mvmnt IV.**

It was not Venus nor Eros
That drew me away
From my cohort

No, Ego, whispered
In my ear seductive
Lies, it told me

The Enemy
The serpent 
The morning Star

Was within me (veritatem dīc omnibus)

And like a knife
Quarters an apple
I should cut it out. 

---
**Mvmnt. V.**

How am I to reconcile my God?
Out of nothing, everything 

And the spirit of God hovered over the waters

She was in the earth and the kosmos
In the traffic and the crosswalks

And God spoke and said, “Let there be light.” 

She told me that we are but ashes and dust and dry bones
A gift of mana and grace imparted

And there was light.

And he said unto me
with a voice like thunder: 

*Veritatem dīc omnibus.*
