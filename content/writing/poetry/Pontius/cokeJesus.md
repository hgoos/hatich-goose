See the destitute Emmanuel 
on the street corner

His mind tricked out 
In a consecrated communion of fentanyl and hard liquor

Transmogrified; 
He sees the shape of things 

His concrete garden of Gethsemane
Rises up to skin his knees
He leans further and further to rest
under the shade of an Olive Street

He preaches to the masses 
Parables of blind men and public transit
Parables of trans prodigal sons and gang violence. 

He holds sermon on the mount of trash
Blessed are the junkies and the druggies
Blessed are the tweakers and the leaners

Blessed are the hobos and the unhoused
Blessed are the scizos and the psychos
For they shall inherit

And from his chapped lips 
Hear the prayer of a man 
Begging for his fate,

<span style="color:#bf0a30">“Aba, aba, spare any change?”</span>
