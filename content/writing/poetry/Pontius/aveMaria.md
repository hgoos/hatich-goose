Hard pressed am I 
By god and holy fire
To think of the Vestal Virgin Mary

Holy she upon the back of a donkey
Pursued by the wolves of Italy
And the serpent of her own people

Her husband, looks upon her with worry
Eyes that see his son clutched tight
In the arms of his beloved wife

And in dead of night they flee
Gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh 
Cover them, the Life of the World
Interred in deathâ€™s scents

Oh sons of David, flee to Egypt 
Bear with ye the tidings of the Virgin Womb.
