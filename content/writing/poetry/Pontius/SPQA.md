<br>
And the prophets communing with God,</br>
Descend the mountain top

Scream and shout til’ their voices are raw
In the seizing of the day

They break down the doors of the Senate
Demanding more

From the legionary

Stars and bars
red and gold 
the banners wave

The eagle, immortalized 
In white and blue
In red and gold

fans the flames
with its wings.

*Sic semper tyrannis*
thus always to tyrants

*Americanae denuo* 
America will be

*magifient iterum.*
great again

*Senatus Populusque Romanus*
the Senate and the People of Rome

The eagle, immolated
fans the flames 
With its wings—

Let us pray.
