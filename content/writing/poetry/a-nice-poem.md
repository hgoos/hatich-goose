## Nostalgia of Days
Where my father's from it's harvest time
The orchards rich with bounties fine

And the days are getting shorter
But I'm still getting older.

Where my mother's from it's raining steady
The humid heat hangs thick and heavy

And the days are getting shorter
But I'm still getting older. 

Where I am from it's turning sweet
the leaves are falling from the trees

And the days are getting shorter
But I'm still getting older.
