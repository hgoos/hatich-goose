**Notes:** These are collections of American Sentences that I have written over the years. This includes my own travel throughout the American Continent and my travel abroad. American sentences don’t have to be about America, I just happen to think about America a lot. American Sentences are a type of form poetry developed by Allen Ginsburg. Like a Haiku, they contain seventeen syllables. Unlike a Haiku, this form (ostensibly) better fits the abilities of the English Language. I’ve been writing these types of poems since I was fifteen or sixteen years old. I think because they are so small they must take a lot of practice to master. I think I still have a long way to go before I could even begin to consider myself a master of this form.
