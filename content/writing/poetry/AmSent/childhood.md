## American *Infancia*

**American *Infancia***
*July 12th, 2024*
I grew up wooded and blooded by the evergreens and black crows.

**American *Espina***
*August 8th, 2025*
I cut my teeth and ankles on blackberry vines and the thick green woods.

---
**American Fair Folk**
*October 22nd, 2024* 

Thatâ€™s where the faeries live; under the gray green of rotting old porches.

**Double American Death Wish**
*June 21st, 2024*
