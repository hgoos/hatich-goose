When first I came unto this land
Across the stormy sea
I brought my binjar and my songs
And all my harmonies. 
I wandered long, a troubadour,
In search of newer sound
And in this land so large and vast
A freshness did abound. 
And lo! It had me in a hold 
of scales and notes so fine,
I could not help but copy-straight
So I could make it mine. 
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">And so I pluck my strings with care and hope that you will hear</span>
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">The echoes of my homeland and the love that I found here.</span>
