Keris is a poet. He is well known for his role in the folktale Alisandre of the Lake, with whom he was in love with. Keris, Alisandre, and Corrinthia of the Bears were deeply embroiled in each other’s lives, living together as lovers. Below is a ballad describing a version of the tale. 

Keris' Sonnets (or Kersian Sonnets, as they are known) are comprised of three quatrains followed by a couplet. The four lines of the quatrain alternate iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter, respectively. The couplet is a fourteener (iambic heptameter). The rhyme scheme is *ABAB CDCD EFEF GG.*

Keris’ poetry regarding Alisandre and Corinthia is often divided into three folios: Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Summer is often hopeful, full of life and describing the prosperous and developing love between the three people. Autumn describes the ultimate downfall of this love as Alisandre rides to war and discovers her family dead. Winter is after the suicide of Alisandre, where Keris deals with the grief of her passing. 



***The Ballad of the Lady Alisandre***

The Lady Alisandre had
Two lovers in the summer high:
The Queen Corrinthia of the Bears;
The Poet Keris of the Isles.

Alice, Alice, Alice
Come back to golden warmth
Alice, Alice, Alice
Come back unto our arms. 

The Poet sang with honeyed voice,
His fingers deft could woo the day,
With gentles runs and woeful songs
He stole red Alice’s heart away

The Queen of Bears was fierce and wild
Her bladed skill was of renown
She’d asked the Lady for her favor
And won it with her victor’s crown. 

And in her court of summer there
In halls enrobed and decked in mirth,
The Poet, Queen, and Lakeshore heir
Found of love they had no dearth. 

Alice, Alice, Alice
Come back to golden warmth
Alice, Alice, Alice
Come back unto our arms. 

But peace like summer, never lasts
And Autumn reached her father’s court
So she kissed her lovers both and
Alisandre rode off to war. 

Alas! Alas! She came to late,
Her father’s house had lo’ been razed 
Her father, brothers, kith and kin
Were char as were the stones within.

Her grief consumed her very being
The land around began to turn
From Autumn brisk to Winter deep
The lake’s dark waters ‘came frozen o’er.

Alice, Alice, Alice,
Come back to golden warmth
Alice, Alice, Alice,
Come back unto our arms. 

No longer did the flame-haired maid
Laugh at the songs her Poet played
No longer did the Queen Bear’s sword 
Stir her blood with its glory. 

But the Poet and the Queen
Could not save Alice from her grief 
And so like Autumn yields to Winter
They watched their Alice yield to her grief. 

Alice, Alice, Alice,
Come back to golden warmth
Alice, Alice, Alice 
Come back unto our arms. 

And so beneath the lake she sleeps,
In icy depths of blue and white
Above the Poet and Bear Queen weep,
For the wint’ry sorrow that took her life.

O’ Alice, Alice, Alice, 
Come back to golden warmth,
O’ Alice, Alice, Alice,
Come back unto our arms.
