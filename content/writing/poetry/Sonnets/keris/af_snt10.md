You stare into the distance love,
(I wish to see your mind)
I see that when you look at me
You look with empty eyes.
You haven’t left your vigil love,
Beside the tower’s port,
You look to where your family lies,
Towards your father’s court.
*Love come in, you’ll catch your death,*
I say, and draw you in,
But worthless are my soothing words
To reach your walls within.
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">I hear your sobs on quiet nights, when you should be asleep,</span>
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">I try to steal away your frown, but you do naught but weep.</span>
