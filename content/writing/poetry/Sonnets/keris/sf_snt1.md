We quarrel oft the Bear and I
she hates my wit and writ,
But she is stubborn as a dog
and I will not submit.
I match the Bear both tooth and claw,
(which she hates the most)
Each parry, jab, and spited word,
I give not ground or post.
The Bear is often in my thoughts
and sometimes in my dreams,
she tracks me down with utmost skill
and then does as she pleases.
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">The Bear she says she loves you best, but I think this a lie,</span>
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">I see the way she looks at me and thinks that she is sly.</span>
