The mountains in a distant haze
the gentle sun above
The sky so blue it goes for days,
like hearts in youthful love. 
The orchards in their verdant rows,
The green that springs from ground,
The smell of rain and blossoms sweet, 
around me do compound. 
Oh spring is such a quiet song,
the birds are in the trees,
And summer comes in baritone,
In heat and harmony.
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">The summer is my favorite love since she is warm and clean,</span>
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">But come she can only if preceded by the spring.</span>
