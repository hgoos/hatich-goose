The sun! The sun! She’s come again,
The cry goes in my mind,
Across my cells both cheers and shouts 
And dopamine collide. 
Oh gracious she, that yellow thing,
Suspended in the sky,
She smiles as I smile back, 
She graces me from high.
The gentle sun whispers such sweet
Sweet nothings in my ear,
She chases back my nimbus dark,
And dissipates my fear. 
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">So in this land of seldom sun, her halo I drink in,</span>
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">For when the seasons turn to grey, I’ll see her little then.</span>
