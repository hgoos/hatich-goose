The brume and mist they hang about
My lake and frontal lobe 
The sun it breaks through far too late
To brighten my abode. 
Tempestuous, the clouds droop low
and lap up at the waves
Amygdala, like cloud-stirred lake
Refuses to behave. 
Hippocampus, she rebels
And she unlike the lake
Has no reason to upheave 
Like wind or snow or slake. 
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">And though I have all everything that anyone could want</span>
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">I find my mind is like the lake in deep gray winter months.</span>
