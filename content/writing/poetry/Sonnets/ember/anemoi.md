At card games I have never been
A deft or winning hand 
I lack the military mind 
that’s built for cards and land. 
But still I fumble through the play
For neither Spring nor Fall
Nor Summer have a better mind 
To win from me at all. 
But Winter she’s a tactful match 
And always calls my bluff 
And steals my winnings like a sponge 
Of darker matter stuff. 
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">But as the days go on and on, the winner’s hand goes slack</span>
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">And bit by bit come longest night my daylight I win back.</span>
