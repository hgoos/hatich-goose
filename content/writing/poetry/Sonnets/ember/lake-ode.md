The Ocean is a fickle Love
Of salt and wind and brine
But she is next to nothing here
Against this mistress mine.
My Lady she is of the lake
and mist and rain and fog
She one moment to the next
Is sullen, angry, calm.
She blows no storms nor winds of strength
Nor brings torrential rains
But batter she this concrete bridge
On which my love sustains.
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">My Lady Lake I fear her not on days when it is clear</span>
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">But when she rages capped in white I know not to draw near.</span>
