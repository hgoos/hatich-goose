I feel each pulse inside me, 
a drawing towards the light,  
And steady goes my beating heart 
Since end of longest night. 
Each day is like a blessing 
The twilight lingers just
A little more with passing days;
I revel in the dusk. 
My mind has been aflame with words 
And fervent they doth pour
Out of my mouth onto the page
Since winters’ losing score. 
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">And so I write with cogent blaze and trail the sun in kind,</span>
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;"><em>God,</em> I think, <em>it’s such a gift to even be alive.</em>
