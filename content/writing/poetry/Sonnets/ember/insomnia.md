I find these days of autumn chill
Straight cut me to the core
My sleepless mind it drifts and drafts
From couch to chair and floor.
I think sometimes that Iâ€™m at fault 
For mind-fog weary ways
And for the time and space I spend
Lost in a sleepy haze.
But still the seasons change and turn
The planet she spins on
And as the sunlight fades away
My smile goes along.
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">So early sleep is how I try to put myself at ease</span>
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">But even then I wake to find the rest is little peace.</span>
