The party will be soon and there
Is still much to be done
The bread is nearly ready and
the chicken’s underdone.
I need to whip the cream and crush
The chickpeas for the stew
My sister is but little help
she sits there next to you. 
She hangs on to your every word 
While the lamb is burning
And Jesus Christ I need some help
The latkes need turning.
<span style="margin-left:2.5em">You look at me with gentle eyes and laughter in your smile,</span>
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">“Martha, come and take a break, just for a little while.”</span>
