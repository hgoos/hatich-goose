And so I stayed and off you went
With your inheritance 
Seeking out a newer high— 
a better life than this. 
As if the tending of the fields
And keeping of the house
Was far beneath your softened hands
And perfectly coifed crown.
And so I stayed and kept the fields
And counted up the grain
I helped our father up the stairs
And served him when in pain.
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">And here you come and father says that I too should rejoice,</span>
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">But I will not—I stayed and served when faced with easier choice.</span>
