Hey, it’s nice to meet you I’m your 
Older brother now
Your face is sweet as honeycomb
Your hair like feathered down. 
Oh baby brother I can’t wait 
to teach you all I know
We’ll play at knights and dragons
And tussle in the snow.
I’ll show you all the bugs and things
That wriggle on the ground
We’ll unearth logs and stones and rocks 
and run through muddy grounds. 
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">O baby brother I will be the lion to your lamb,</span> 
<span style="margin-left:2.5em;">I’ll keep you safe, I’ll watch your back, I’ll do the best I can.</span>
