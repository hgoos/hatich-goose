  description: "I've been trying to write sonnets since I first started reading them. English Sonnets were my most common attempts, but something felt...unatural about them. In a college class we were assigned to invent a form of poetry. I didnâ€™t invent the Kerisian Sonnet there, but after. I created a sonnet that fits my internal rhythm for a character who is a poet. Keris. If you are curious about the form and the poet, I would direct you to the post at the top of this page regarding the Sonnets of Keris."
