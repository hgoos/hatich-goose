  description: "I’ve been trying to write sonnets since I first started reading them. Mostly English Sonnets. As it turns out, I suck at English Sonnets. Granted, Shakespeare and the others had hundreds and hundreds of hours on me by the time I picked up the form, but something just felt… unnatural about English Sonnets. In Andrew Feld’s ENG 283 we had to invent our own form of poetry. I didn’t invent the Kerisian Sonnet there, but after. I created a sonnet that fits my internal rhythm for a character who is a poet. Keris. A Kerisian Sonnet is as follows: 3 stanzas of 4 lines with a couplet at the end. The 4 lines alternate iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter, respectively. The 4 lines form an ABCB rhyme scheme. The couplet is a fourteener (iambic heptameter). Even though it's my own form I have a long way to go before I get it down. I mostly created it cause I’m lazy and wanted to make form poetry easier for myself."
