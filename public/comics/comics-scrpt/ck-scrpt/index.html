<p><strong>Panel 1A (Wide)</strong><br>
SUPERMAN sitting in his costume on the edge of a Gotham rooftop, overlooking the city. He is silhouetted by the skyline. It is night time.</p>
<p><strong>Panel 1B</strong><br>
We see SUPERMAN’s back. The silhouette of a cape takes up the right quarter of the panel.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>SILHOUETTE</em><br>
Superman.
</br>
<p><strong>Panel 1A (second)</strong><br>
SUPERMAN glancing back to see ROBIN (DAMIAN) standing behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">

Damian? Isn’t it past your bedtime?
</br>
<hr>
<h2 id="page-2">Page 2</h2>
<p><strong>Panel 1A</strong><br>
ROBIN approaching. SUPERMAN watches him fondly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">

I don’t have a bedtime. Tt. I heard you were in town so I gave Alfred the slip.
</br>
<p><strong>Panel 1A (second)</strong><br>
ROBIN sitting down, criss-cross-applesauce, next to SUPERMAN.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>ROBIN</em><br>
Were you expecting my father?
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>SUPERMAN</em><br>
I was hoping he would show.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>ROBIN</em><br>
He’s a busy man. I believe tonight he must make an appearance as Bruce Wayne.
</p>
<p><strong>Panel 1B</strong><br>
ROBIN sitting next to SUPERMAN.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>SUPERMAN</em><br>
That’s right, the GCPD Gala, he mentioned that earlier this week.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>ROBIN</em><br>
So, what seems to be wrong, Uncle Clark?
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="page-3">Page 3</h2>
<p><strong>Panel 2A</strong><br>
In profile, SUPERMAN frowns and looks down. ROBIN, also in profile, sits in the foreground.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>ROBIN</em><br>
Was this about earlier today?<br>
(Interpanel)<br>
Father told me what happened.
</p>
<p><strong>Panel 2B</strong><br>
Close-up of SUPERMAN. He is frowning, his eyes closed, as if he doesn’t want to remember what ROBIN is talking about.</p>
<p><strong>3 x 2 Panel Structure (Read Left-Right)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Panel 1:</strong> Close up a man’s face. He is screaming, yelling, visibly upset.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>CAPTION (DAMIAN)</em><br>
Assailant was Miles Greenway.
</p>
<p><strong>Panel 2:</strong> A man with an automatic rifle firing inside of a school entrance. The children are running away from him in fear.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>CAPTION</em><br>
He was bullied throughout his highschool and middle school career.
</p>
<p><strong>Panel 3:</strong> CLARK, working at his desk, hears something.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>CAPTION</em><br>
You stopped him from committing suicide at age 18, 10 years ago.
</p>
<p><strong>Panel 4 (panel 2):</strong> SUPERMAN streaks in and steals the gun.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>CAPTION</em><br>
Today, he returned to his old high school and attempted to terrorize it.
</p>
<p><strong>Panel 5:</strong> SUPERMAN towers over a cowering MILES.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>CAPTION</em><br>
He had plans for his old middle school as well.
</p>
<p><strong>Panel 6:</strong> SUPERMAN’s eyes flash, and tears are running down his face.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>CAPTION</em><br>
But you stopped him.
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="page-4">Page 4</h2>
<p><strong>Panel 2B (second)</strong><br>
SUPERMAN looking down, almost guilty.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>SUPERMAN</em><br>
If that’s what you want to call it.
</p>
<p><strong>Panel 2A (second)</strong><br>
SUPERMAN is looking at ROBIN and giving him a slight smile.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>ROBIN</em><br>
That’s what I am calling it, Uncle Clark.<br>
You stopped him without violence and no one, including the man, was hurt.<br>
Why are you still upset?
</p>
<p><strong>Panel 1A (second)</strong><br>
SUPERMAN, eyes downcast. ROBIN remains impassive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>SUPERMAN</em><br>
I just forgot people can be cruel.
</p>
<p><strong>Panel 1B (second)</strong><br>
ROBIN, sitting next to SUPERMAN.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>SUPERMAN</em><br>
It’s…been a while since I’ve been reminded of that.
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="page-5">Page 5</h2>
<p><strong>Panel 1</strong><br>
ROBIN sits criss-cross-applesauce.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>ROBIN</em><br>
I’m reminded of it everyday.
</p>
<p><strong>Panel 2A</strong><br>
SUPERMAN glancing at ROBIN. He is frowning. ROBIN’s mouth is open, as if he’s speaking.</p>
<p><strong>1x3 Panel Structure (Read Left-Right)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Panel 1:</strong> A woman, presumably TALIA AL-GHUL, holding a flamberge in the foreground. In the background, a younger version of DAMIAN holding a sword of his own at the ready.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>CAPTION (DAMIAN)</em><br>
My own mother honed me into a tool for violence.
</p>
<p><strong>Panel 2:</strong> DAMIAN, in his League of Shadows/Assassins gear, crouching on a building edge. Behind him, silhouettes of skyscrapers loom.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>CAPTION</em><br>
I…
</p>
<p><strong>Panel 3:</strong> A man in a suit, lying in a pool of his own blood. In the foreground, DAMIAN (still in his League gear) walks out of frame.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>CAPTION</em><br>
I did that for a while too.
</p>
<p><strong>Panel 1A (second)</strong><br>
SUPERMAN glances to the side at ROBIN.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>ROBIN</em><br>
Father says it’s naive to expect people to be kind in a world that was so cruel to them.<br>
He says I can’t get upset every time someone disappoints me in that regard.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>SUPERMAN</em><br>
Your father is a smart man, Damian, but he doesn’t always---
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>ROBIN</em><br>
But I agree.<br>
I was a cruel person Uncle Clark, for a long time. But I was also a child. I didn’t have a choice. I’ve learned that you have to let some of these things go. You have to let the cruelty of people go. You can’t give it too much thought. If you do you let it live. You let it become something. Because in the end it doesn’t matter. What matters is you tried to help. And you tried your best.
</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="page-5-1">Page 5</h1>
<p><strong>Panel 1</strong><br>
SUPERMAN smiles at ROBIN.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>SUPERMAN</em><br>
You’re a good kid, Damian. Anyone ever tell you that?
</p>
<p><strong>Panel 2</strong><br>
ROBIN, looking towards the audience, smirking.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>ROBIN</em><br>
Once or twice.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>CAPTION</em><br>
End.
