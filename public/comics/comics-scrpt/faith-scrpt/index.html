Coloring and lighting practice here as well.<br>
There is certainly a way to condense this script so that it’s shorter and makes more efficient use of space. However, want to acknowledge that in a shorter script the writer has more control over the panel structure. In a 6+ issue run it’s tedious and inefficient for the writer to try and retain full control over every single panel and every single page.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also aware that this story is heavily influenced by my own personal beliefs about Superman and his upbringing. Being raised in a rural Kansas farm town, he probably would&rsquo;ve grown up going to Protestant chruch. However, I do not want to erase or ignore the fact that Superman (and most comcics) are products of Jewish-American creators and experiences. I don&rsquo;t think this comic would ever be published in an anthology, nor would I necessarily want it to. I think it&rsquo;s ok if Clark Kent and Superman remain neutral. I&rsquo;ll leave that Catholic Guilt to Matt Murdock. I think what matters more is that Superman and Clark Kent embody and display kindness and hope above all&mdash;religious affiliations aside.</p>

<p>Half-splash. In an over the shoulder aerial shot, SUPERMAN is descending from the sky. He is visibly dirty and dusty. It’s dawn. Below is a cathedral.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="page-2">Page 2</h2>
<p><strong>Panel 1:</strong> Vertical wide shot, upward angle. SUPERMAN descends. He lands on the steps and is walking up them in stroboscope (1-2 images).</p>
<p><strong>Panel 2:</strong> As if from the altar, the church doors. Again, in stroboscope SUPERMAN walking towards panel, down the pews. 1-3 images. Remember he is dirty.</p>

<h2 id="page-3">Page 3</h2>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Half-splash. Aerial view from the rafters of the cathedral. SUPERMAN sits in one of the pews. Light filters in through the stained glass windows. SUPERMAN is alone in the sanctuary.</p>
<p><strong>2x3 Panels, Separated, Read Top-Down Left Right</strong><br>
The panels line each side of the page, with SUPERMAN praying in the middle.<br>
Each panel contains details of the stained glass windows, of which there are six. These depict various scenes from the Bible, or various biblical images.</p>
