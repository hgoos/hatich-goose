    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Keris is a poet. He is well known for his role in the folktale Alisandre of the Lake, with whom he was in love with. Keris, Alisandre, and Corrinthia of the Bears were deeply embroiled in each other’s lives, living together as lovers. Below is a ballad describing a version of the tale.</p>
<p>Keris&rsquo; Sonnets (or Kersian Sonnets, as they are known) are comprised of three quatrains followed by a couplet. The four lines of the quatrain alternate iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter, respectively. The couplet is a fourteener (iambic heptameter). The rhyme scheme is <em>ABAB CDCD EFEF GG.</em></p>
<p>Keris’ poetry regarding Alisandre and Corinthia is often divided into three folios: Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Summer is often hopeful, full of life and describing the prosperous and developing love between the three people. Autumn describes the ultimate downfall of this love as Alisandre rides to war and discovers her family dead. Winter is after the suicide of Alisandre, where Keris deals with the grief of her passing.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Ballad of the Lady Alisandre</strong></em></p>
<p>The Lady Alisandre had<br>
Two lovers in the summer high:<br>
The Queen Corrinthia of the Bears;<br>
The Poet Keris of the Isles.</p>
<p>Alice, Alice, Alice<br>
Come back to golden warmth<br>
Alice, Alice, Alice<br>
Come back unto our arms.</p>
<p>The Poet sang with honeyed voice,<br>
His fingers deft could woo the day,<br>
With gentles runs and woeful songs<br>
He stole red Alice’s heart away</p>
<p>The Queen of Bears was fierce and wild<br>
Her bladed skill was of renown<br>
She’d asked the Lady for her favor<br>
And won it with her victor’s crown.</p>
<p>And in her court of summer there<br>
In halls enrobed and decked in mirth,<br>
The Poet, Queen, and Lakeshore heir<br>
Found of love they had no dearth.</p>
<p>Alice, Alice, Alice<br>
Come back to golden warmth<br>
Alice, Alice, Alice<br>
Come back unto our arms.</p>
<p>But peace like summer, never lasts<br>
And Autumn reached her father’s court<br>
So she kissed her lovers both and<br>
Alisandre rode off to war.</p>
<p>Alas! Alas! She came to late,<br>
Her father’s house had lo’ been razed<br>
Her father, brothers, kith and kin<br>
Were char as were the stones within.</p>
<p>Her grief consumed her very being<br>
The land around began to turn<br>
From Autumn brisk to Winter deep<br>
The lake’s dark waters ‘came frozen o’er.</p>
<p>Alice, Alice, Alice,<br>
Come back to golden warmth<br>
Alice, Alice, Alice,<br>
Come back unto our arms.</p>
<p>No longer did the flame-haired maid<br>
Laugh at the songs her Poet played<br>
No longer did the Queen Bear’s sword<br>
Stir her blood with its glory.</p>
<p>But the Poet and the Queen<br>
Could not save Alice from her grief<br>
And so like Autumn yields to Winter<br>
They watched their Alice yield to her grief.</p>
<p>Alice, Alice, Alice,<br>
Come back to golden warmth<br>
Alice, Alice, Alice<br>
Come back unto our arms.</p>
<p>And so beneath the lake she sleeps,<br>
In icy depths of blue and white<br>
Above the Poet and Bear Queen weep,<br>
For the wint’ry sorrow that took her life.</p>
<p>O’ Alice, Alice, Alice,<br>
Come back to golden warmth,<br>
O’ Alice, Alice, Alice,<br>
Come back unto our arms.</p>
