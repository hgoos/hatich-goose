With your inheritance
Seeking out a newer high—
a better life than this.
As if the tending of the fields
And keeping of the house
Was far beneath your softened hands
And perfectly coifed crown.
And so I stayed and kept the fields
And counted up the grain
I helped our father up the stairs
And served him when in pain.
And here you come and father says that I too should rejoice,
But I will not—I stayed and served when faced with easier choice.">
