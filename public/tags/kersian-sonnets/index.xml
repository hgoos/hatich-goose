      <description>&lt;p&gt;Keris is a poet. He is well known for his role in the folktale Alisandre of the Lake, with whom he was in love with. Keris, Alisandre, and Corrinthia of the Bears were deeply embroiled in each other’s lives, living together as lovers. Below is a ballad describing a version of the tale.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keris’ poetry regarding Alisandre and Corinthia is often divided into three folios: Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Summer is often hopeful, full of life and describing the prosperous and developing love between the three people. Autumn describes the ultimate downfall of this love as Alisandre rides to war and discovers her family dead. Winter is after the suicide of Alisandre, where Keris deals with the grief of her passing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When first I came unto this land&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Across the stormy sea&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I brought my binjar and my songs&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And all my harmonies.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I wandered long, a troubadour,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In search of newer sound&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And in this land so large and vast&lt;br&gt;&#xA;A freshness did abound.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;And lo! It had me in a hold&lt;br&gt;&#xA;of scales and notes so fine,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I could not help but copy-straight&lt;br&gt;&#xA;So I could make it mine.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-left:2.5em;&#34;&gt;And so I pluck my strings with care and hope that you will hear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-left:2.5em;&#34;&gt;The echoes of my homeland and the love that I found here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We quarrel oft the Bear and I&lt;br&gt;&#xA;she hates my wit and writ,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;But she is stubborn as a dog&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and I will not submit.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I match the Bear both tooth and claw,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;(which she hates the most)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Each parry, jab, and spited word,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I give not ground or post.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The Bear is often in my thoughts&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and sometimes in my dreams,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;she tracks me down with utmost skill&lt;br&gt;&#xA;and then does as she pleases.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-left:2.5em;&#34;&gt;The Bear she says she loves you best, but I think this a lie,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;span style=&#34;margin-left:2.5em;&#34;&gt;I see the way she looks at me and thinks that she is sly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
